# lrsinglelinkedlist
Single linked list implementation in C 

Note this is a work in progress

1. Clone repo
2. Install check unit testing library - https://libcheck.github.io/check/
3. If using Clion open the repo as a new project. If not then create an empty build directory in the repo folder and run "cmake .." from there
4. Run 'make' from within the build folder. The library will be output as <yourlibrary>.a and the test executable will be testexec.
   Alternatively CLion users can run "Build All" and specify the testexec as the executable

If you want to run valgrind on unit tests be sure to uncomment the fork
