# CStaticLibSeed
Single linked list implementation in C 

Note this is a work in progress

1. Clone repo
2. If using Clion open the repo as a new project. If not then create an empty build directory in the repo folder and run "cmake .." from there
3. Run 'make' from within the build folder. The library will be output as <yourlibrary>.a and the test executable will be testexec.
   Alternatively CLion users can run "Build All" and specify the testexec as the executable
